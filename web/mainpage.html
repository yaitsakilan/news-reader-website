<b> Did India Spot a Chinese Spy Balloon-type Object a year ago?
know here</b>  

<img class="air" src="mainpage new img.jpeg">

<h4>The Chinese balloon that crossed the continental US from Alaska to the east coast in February did not collect any information, the Pentagon says.the US "took steps to mitigate" what intelligence the suspected spy balloon could collect, officials said on Thursday.
Debris collected from the balloon after it was shot down is being analysed by US intelligence agencies.
The incident caused a strain between the US and China.
Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said on Thursday that the US was "aware that [the balloon] had intelligence collection capabilities".
But "it has been our assessment now that it did not collect while it was transiting the United States or over flying the United States".
He said the efforts the US took to mitigate any intelligence gathering "contributed" to the balloon's failure to gather sensitive information.
Gen Ryder did not confirm a Wall Street Journal report that American-made equipment was part of the balloon, but he said that Chinese drones in the past have used off-the-shelf US equipment.
In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-16 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources.
The second missile hit the target. Each Sidewinder missile costs more than $400,000 (£330,000).
Strange flying objects - unanswered questions
How has China reacted to the balloon saga?
Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the first balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target.
White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down "out of an abundance of caution".
They did not pose "any direct threat to people on the ground", but were destroyed "to protect our security, our interests and flight safety", he said.
The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses. 
The second object, over Alaska, was described as the size of a "small car". The third object, over the Yukon, was "cylindrical". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be "octagonal" with strings attached. 
A Pentagon memo later reported in US media said the flying object shot down over Yukon appeared to be a "small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it".
On Tuesday, Mr Kirby said that the objects did not appear to be involved in intelligence collection and "could be balloons that were simply tied to commercial or research entities, and therefore benign".
But he noted no company, organisation or government have said they were the owners of the objects.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday.
Amid the row over high-altitude aircraft, America's top diplomat cancelled a visit to Beijing that was initially planned for last week.
Meanwhile, in a sign of heightened tensions over the incidents in the US, Romania scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday to investigate an aerial object entering European airspace.
But the country's defence ministry said the pilots were unable to locate it and abandoned the mission after half an hour.Strange flying objects - unanswered questions
